$arrFPAboutUs['body'] = '<p>IncludeME is an online toolbox for young people to use in mental health services such as clinics, schools and the community. IncludeME is based on a clinical approach called shared decision making which aims to allow young people and their families to work together with the people supporting them.<br>
<br>IncludeME encourages young people to play a more active role in their care by picking and choosing tools and activities that help them on their journey.<br>
<br>These tools can help young people to:</p>
<ul class="list">
    <li>Explore relationships</li>
    <li>Record and review progress</li>
    <li>Weigh up decisions</li>
    <li>Complete questionnaires</li>
    <li>Create their own library of resources using the IncludeME library which is full of helpful information.</li>
    <li>Customise their personal toolbox.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Most of the tools can be accessed on computers, tablets and smart phones. These tools might be used together with a supporting adult in session, or can be used at home independently by a young person.
