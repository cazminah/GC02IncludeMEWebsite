							<div class="faqDiv">
								No, at any point you can ask your worker to stop using includeME. If you change your mind at any time and decide you do want to give it a try, all you have to do is speak to your worker and they can sign you up.

								Anything entered as part of the outcome measures (questionnaires) will be treated in exactly the same way as the paper versions except it will be handled by secure servers (if you are unsure what these are, or how this information is used, please ask your worker),.

							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="faqItem">How long will I use IncludeME for?</span>
