			 					<div class="faqDiv">
				 					<ul class="clinicianSubLists">
				 						<li>
				 							<span class="faqItem">How is access to the IncludeME platform controlled?</span>
				 							<div class="faqSubDiv">The platform is available via the internet using one specified URL or IP address through standard internet protocols (HTTP or HTTPS). Access to the platform is via secure log in only. Login details are currently only given to sites who have agreed to be part of the pilot.</div>
				 						</li>
				 						<li>
				 							<span class="faqItem">Would the site I work in need Wifi access and who will make sure this is the case?</span>
				 							<div class="faqSubDiv">You will need access to the internet to use IncludeME either through Wifi or cable connection. The platform will also work through 3G, although a Wifi or cable connection is preferable.
											</div>
				 						</li>
				 						<li>
				 							<span class="faqItem">Will we need access to a particular web browser?</span>
				 							<div class="faqSubDiv">No. The platform will be optimised for all of the main web browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer (some problems may persist on older versions of Internet Explorer) and Safari.
											</div>
				 						</li>
				 						<li>
				 							<span class="faqItem">How secure is the data, what level of authentication and encryption does IncludeME use and where is the data stored?</span>
				 							<div class="faqSubDiv">Information is only sent over https with high grade encryption (AES-256). The data is stored in SilverCloud's secure servers in London. SilverCloud is an ISO27001 certified company.<br /><a style="" href="http://certificationeurope.com/certificates/SIlverCloud%20Health%20ISO27001%20CertA1%20ED2016.pdf">Click for more information</a>			
											</div>
				 						</li>
				 						<li>
				 							<span class="faqItem">Should I access the platform on a desktop, laptop or a tablet?</span>
				 							<div class="faqSubDiv">The EBPU recommends the use a tablet for accessing the platform as this provides the most mobile and interactive solution within a therapeutic environment. However, it is also possible to access the platform via a desktop or laptop computer and it is also anticipated that access will be optimised for mobile phones at a later date.
											</div>
				 						</li>
				 						<li>
				 							<span class="faqItem">What do I do if there is a technical issue? Who do I contact?</span>
				 							<div class="faqSubDiv">The team at SilverCloud are available to provide technical support. Contact details are below and can also be found on the platform itself.

											<br /><br />If you are a young person requiring technical support, please contact SilverCloud Health by emailing: <a href="support@silvercloudhealth.com">	support@silvercloudhealth.com</a><br />If you are a clinician requiring technical support, please contact SilverCloud Health either by the email address provided above or by telephoning:  0207 183 8452.
											</div>
				 						</li>
				 						<li>
				 							<span class="faqItem">Will we need to get consent from parents for their child to be given access?</span>
				 							<div class="faqSubDiv">Yes, consent will need to be sought from the child’s parents/carers. In some cases the professional may decide that a young person is ‘Gillick competent’ and has the capacity and maturity to consent to accessing the platform without the consent of a parent or carer.<br /><br />For cases requiring consent, a template consent form will be distributed to services, which can then be altered if required, based on service level requirements.
				 							</div>
				 						</li>
				 						<li>
				 							<span class="faqItem">Who gives access to the platform and sets permissions, is this task completed by the provider or done locally?</span>
				 							<div class="faqSubDiv">This is done locally on a site basis; there are different levels of access including administrator, practitioner and client (young person). All site administrators will provide practitioners with access to the platform. Administrators and practitioners will then be able to add clients to the platform.<br /><br /> 
											It is also now possible for a young person to access the platform in between sessions, using their own login details. This level of access can be granted by the practitioner and the type of access can be determined for different tools so that they can be locked, viewed or edited by the young person. Any tools that have been locked will not be visible once the young person has logged in. 
											</div>
				 						</li>
				 						<li>
				 							<span class="faqItem">When creating a log for a young person are you creating an anonymous ID or will it be their name? </span>
				 							<div class="faqSubDiv">The username can be anything you wish to assign to the young person. The chosen username needs to be meaningful to the therapist working with the young person, to allow them to select the desired client from an ID list during future sessions. In order to protect a young person’s identity, any information requested by the EBPU for development and evaluation purposes will be sought in an anonymised form.
				 							</div>
				 						</li>
				 						<li>
				 							<span class="faqItem">What front end reports are available to us?</span>
				 							<div class="faqSubDiv">Administrators and practitioners can generate reports offering large range of functionality, including:<br /><br />
				 								<ul>
				 									<li>Average time of session</li>
				 									<li>Feedback graphs</li>
				 									<li>Use of different features of the platform</li>
				 									<li>When it was accessed</li>
				 								</ul>
				 								<br />These can be exported using PDF, Excel and CSV.
				 								<br /><br />
				 								It is also possible to export data from the outcome measures tool on the platform. This data can be exported to fulfil CYP IAPT (V4.1) and CORC+ requirements. This means any of the measures can be exported as a CSV file in line with the data specification and can then be uploaded to particular record systems for reporting purposes.

				 									Face to face “training” as such will not happen on a national basis, however guidance and information documents will be provided, alongside events which will provide basic guidance. The guidance documents currently take the form of a ‘getting started guide’ which provides technical information on how to navigate the different areas of the platform as well as detailed guidance on how to set up different people on the platform. Furthermore, there is also a ‘practitioners guide’ which provides further details on the different tools currently available as well as suggestions on how these might be used in a clinical setting. Out of session guidance; ‘make IncludeME your own’ has also been created to guide services through technical set up of out of session access in addition to suggestions for use.

					 						<li>
					 							<span class="faqItem">How is risk being managed?</span>
					 							<div class="faqSubDiv">
					 								During the first iteration of the project, risk was closely monitored as access was restricted to in-session use only. This was to allow for sufficient consultation with services and risk management protocols to be explored and implemented.
					 								<br /><br />
					 								Due to increasing demand for out of session access to the tools, out of session access is now available. Guidance documents have been created and circulated to ensure that services are adhering to their own risk management protocols and are responsible for providing out of session access in a safe and responsible way; using clinical judgement to determine which young people have this level of access.
					 								<br /><br />
					 								As part of the development of out of session access, we have ensured that clinicians are free to use their judgement to determine different levels of access. That is; clinicians can select between tools which are locked (not accessible), viewed or edited by the young person. We have also created a pop up message to appear every time a young person logs in independently to ensure EBPU safeguarding policies have been followed. The message reads:
					 								<br /><br />
					 								<q>Please note that anything you do or write in this area between now and your next session will not be seen by anyone else. To find out more about accessing IncludeME out of your sessions, please speak to your practitioner. If you would like additional help and support, please have a look at the list of helplines in the ‘help’ area of the platform or speak to your GP or someone in your support network. In an emergency requiring immediate help, please call 999 or go to your local A&E department.</q>
					 							</div>
					 						</li>
					 						<li>
					 							<span class="faqItem">Will there be an expectation that clinicians are accessing the platform between sessions?</span>
					 							<div class="faqSubDiv">
					 								As above, the pop up message on the platform makes it clear that the platform will not be checked between sessions. It is then the service’s responsibility to ensure that clinicians are having further conversations with the young people they work with to ensure they discuss any expectations or concerns around between-session access.
					 							</div>
					 						</li>
					 						<li>
					 							<span class="faqItem">Who takes clinical responsibility and what do I do if any clinical risk is highlighted?</span>
					 							<div class="faqSubDiv">
					 								Clinicians using the platform take clinical responsibility, and should follow standard local procedures if any risk is highlighted through use of the platform.

					 					<ul class="clinicianSubLists">
					 						<li>
					 							<span class="faqItem">Are the resources on the site mainly psycho-educational or will there be psychotherapeutic resources as well?</span>
					 							<div class="faqSubDiv">Many of the resources created during the earlier stages of development were of a psychotherapeutic nature, designed to support in-session work. During the final phase of development we shifted some of our focus to promoting self-management in young people through the creation of a resource area called ‘My Library’; focusing more on self-management and psycho-education</div>
					 						</li>
					 						<li>
					 							<span class="faqItem">Are there targets we have to meet?</span>
					 							<div class="faqSubDiv">We are not specifying targets at this stage but we may set benchmark figures as the project progresses, especially if we notice the platform is not being accessed as much as we hope it might be.</div>
					 						</li>
					 						<li>
					 							<span class="faqItem">Is there a particular age group that the site is designed for?</span>
					 							<div class="faqSubDiv">Many of the tools that have been developed are not age-specific, with the exception of age limitations on the use of outcome measures such as the RCADS. This means that you can use the platform with any young person that you feel it is clinically appropriate to. In terms of the design and language used on the platform, we have focussed our efforts on the 10-14 age range; however there is scope for extending this depending on the feedback we receive.</div>
					 						</li>
					 						<li>
					 							<span class="faqItem">How should we manage cases where the client does not wish to use IncludeME at all, or wishes to stop using the platform?</span>
					 							<div class="faqSubDiv">
					 								Clinicians will be able to close accounts and stop access to the platform. Any client that does not wish to use IncludeME should have this choice respected and the reasons for this discussed and fed back as appropriate to the clinical staff and to the project team where relevant.

					 							<span class="faqItem">What is available on the platform?</span>
					 							<div class="faqSubDiv">
					 								The platform has been created to encourage young people and their supporters to take an active role in their care, to have their voices heard and ultimately empower them to be more involved in their therapeutic journey; through the use of a shared decision making, collaborative approach and self-management tools.
					 								<br /><br />
					 								It is hoped that the platform will provide clinicians with easy access to a ‘toolbox’ of clinical tools and materials which can be used successfully with a range of children and young people in a variety of settings.
					 								<br /><br />
					 								The platform currently houses the following tools:
					 								<br />
					 								<ul>
					 									<li>My profile</li>
					 									<li>Measures (all CYP IAPT measures in line with the data specification v4.1)</li>
					 									<li>My Sessions</li>
					 									<li>My Relationships</li>
					 									<li>My Strengths</li>
					 									<li>Doodle Draw</li>
					 									<li>Feelings Explorer</li>
					 									<li>Doodle Goals</li>
					 									<li>Shared Agreement</li>
					 									<li>My Decisions</li>
					 									<li>Getting to Know You</li>
					 									<li>My Libray</li>
					 									<li>My Plans</li>
					 								</ul>
					 								<br /><br />
					 								For more detailed information on each of the tools, how to access them and suggestions for clinical use, please consult the ‘getting started’ and ‘practitioner guide’ documents.
					 							</div>
					 						</li>
					 						<li>
					 							<span class="faqItem">Do I have to use everything on the platform even if it’s not relevant?</span>
					 							<div class="faqSubDiv">
					 								No. We hope that clinicians will feel that all areas of the platform are clinically relevant and provide support within a range of service users across many different settings. However, it is entirely up to you in terms of how much of the platform you use, when you use it and who you use it with in sessions. 
					 								<br /><br />
													If you feel that particular tools are not relevant to your work and not appropriate for some of the young people you work with, you have the option to lock individual tools and set these as ‘hidden’; allowing you to personalise the platform to individual needs.

				 								<div class="faqSubDiv">
				 									It is designed as a standalone clinical tool however we are still keen to explore links with patient record systems. This will depend on a couple of things:
				 									<br /><br />
				 									<ol>
				 										<li>Service providers being willing to work with SilverCloud Health (our contracted software developers)</li>
				 										<li>Services funding the cost of this linkage by development of an appropriate API.</li>
				 									</ol>
				 									<br />
				 									All current service providers have been contacted to discuss the possibility of linking IncludeME with their system. We will continue to explore this and facilitate links where possible.

					 						<li>
					 							<span class="faqItem">Doesn’t the platform pose a risk to the therapeutic alliance? </span>
					 							<div class="faqSubDiv">
					 								This is a big question and one which can’t easily be answered, and we understand that different clinicians will vary on their opinion of this. Our aim is for the platform to support and increase therapeutic alliance by providing a shared space for therapists and young people to share their thoughts/progress and try out tools together.
					 								<br /><br />
					 								Feedback from young people as part of our initial consultation indicated very positive attitudes towards the platform, and we hope that through continued refinement and iterative development, we will have a tool that supports rather than risks therapeutic alliance.
					 								<br /><br />
					 								At the same time however, there will always be clinicians and young people that don’t want to use any online tools, and we are not trying to create a “one-size-fits all” product.
					 								<br /><br />
					 								There is also literature in this area which the team have reviewed and can direct you to. General findings suggest that attitudes towards existing web based platforms are broadly positive, and do not negatively impact therapeutic alliance.
					 							</div>
					 						</li>
					 						<li>
					 							<span class="faqItem">How will my staff manage the culture change?</span>
					 							<div class="faqSubDiv">
					 								The project has been designed so that culture change will take place slowly, and from the bottom up. We have asked services to identify a small number of clinicians who are willing and motivated to try the platform as “early implementers”, and we hope that these clinicians will be able to share and spread enthusiasm and uptake for the platform.
					 								<br /><br />
					 								We are also following a number of key principles, drawing on previous projects taken forward by the unit as well as others’ recommendations, around how to spread innovation effectively, and we will continue to learn throughout the project. Some of the key principles we are adopting include:
					 								<br /><br />
					 								<ol>
					 									<li>Strengthen and exploit provider autonomy</li>
					 									<li>Engage and mobilise patients and carers </li>
					 									<li>Build alliances across internal and external networks </li>
					 									<li>Acknowledge necessary instability and fluidity </li>

				 							<li>
				 								<span class="faqItem">How much time will it take up?</span>
				 								<div class="faqSubDiv">
				 									Using the platform should take up as little or as much time as you’d like it to. We are hoping to design the platform in such a way that it makes clinical sense for users, so it shouldn’t take much time to find what you need on there and access it in a way which works for you.

													We acknowledge that the platform is likely to take longer to get used to during the earlier stages of the project, as it will be unfamiliar and very new to lots of clinicians. It is for this reason that the project team were so keen to involve only those services and clinicians who were highly motivated at this stage as engagement with the project and an eagerness to use the platform within sessions are vital in ensuring a smooth and successful roll out into services.

We are currently exploring options for future funding and also considering ways in which we market the platform as a product. This process relies very much on the feedback we receive from clinicians, young people and commissioners involved in the project, as we want to ensure that the platform encompasses the needs of a wide audience and remains relevant beyond the pilot.</div>

					 							<div class="faqSubDiv">
					 								It is our hope that IncludeME will become a tool that is fully integrated into clinical work (where it is appropriate), and that services will want to use it beyond the life of the project. In order to achieve this we have to focus our efforts on a number of key principles: <br />
					 								<ul>
					 									<li>Safety</li>
					 									<li>Evidence based</li>
					 									<li>Flexible</li>
					 									<li>Interactive</li>
					 									<li>Accessible</li>
					 									<li>Useful</li>
					 									<li>Sustainable</li>
					 								</ul>
					 								<br />
					 								The project’s steering group, which meets on a quarterly basis, will be tasked with ensuring the direction of the project is in keeping with these principles and our hope is that if these are central to the platform, there will be take-up beyond March 2016.

							<ul class="faqList"> 
								<li>
									<span class="faqItem">What is IncludeME?</span>
									<div class="faqDiv">
										IncludeME is an exciting and innovative interactive platform, designed to support and improve the care that children and young people receive when accessing mental health services; in clinics, schools and the community. 
										<br /><br />
										The platform has been created as part of a 3 year project, developed by the EBPU at the Anna Freud Centre and funded by the Department of Health. The EBPU are working with software developers SilverCloudHealth to develop the platform and service user participation organisation Common Room. The platform has been designed over a phased roll-out, over which time feedback from young people, clinicians, teachers and stakeholders has allowed us to develop and refine a platform which is user friendly, engaging and relevant for young people and those supporting them.
										<br /><br />
										The platform has been created to encourage young people and their supporters to take an active role in the care they receive, by widening the boundaries to communication and providing vulnerable young people and their families with the opportunity to have their voices heard. 
										<br /><br />
										IncludeME is most often used in session with a worker using a tablet or computer. Some workers may also grant young people out of session access so they can access the resources or complete measures in their own time at home.
									</div>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="faqItem">What are the aims of the project?</span>
									<div class="faqDiv">
										IncludeME aims to empower young people to be more involved in their therapeutic journey; through the use of a shared decision making approach as well as collaborative and self-management tools. The tools include those designed to:
										<br /><br />
										<ul>
											<li>Help young people and therapists jointly review progress and set goals;</li>
											<li>Encourage young people to reflect on their strengths and explore relationships;</li>
											<li>Help young people understand their rights and increase their knowledge about options;</li>
											<li>Facilitate the young person sharing information and self-manage;</li>
											<li>Provide an easy way of completing and reviewing questionnaires.</li>
										</ul>
									</div>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="faqItem">Is there a particular age group that the site is designed for?</span>
									<div class="faqDiv">
										No, many of the tools available on the platform are not age specific, with the exception of age limitations on certain questionnaires. The platform was originally designed for young people aged 10-14, however, this isn’t set in stone and it can be used by both younger and older children. This means that young people of any age can use the platform if their clinician or support worker thinks it would be helpful. 
									</div>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="faqItem">What tools are on the platform?</span>
									<div class="faqDiv">
										IncludeME has been designed to provide a clinical toolbox, made up of a number of different tools and resources, designed to support young people in their care and encourage them to feel ownership over their treatment.
										<br /><br />
										The platform currently contains the following tools:
										<br /><br />
										<ul></ul>
									</div>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="faqItem">What happens to information entered onto the platform?</span>
									<div class="faqDiv">
										Anything you do or enter onto IncludeME will remain on the platform and will be held by secure servers so that it is safe. The only time that information might be taken from the platform is if you or you young person complete a questionnaire. However, your clinician or support worker will always ask your permission before they do this. The only time that any other information will be taken from IncludeME is if you and your worker agree that this would be helpful for you.
									</div>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="faqItem">Are parents able to use IncludeME?</span>
									<div class="faqDiv">
										Parents and/or carers will be able to complete questionnaires and take part in using tools with the therapist and young person as appropriate during session time, for example, parent versions of outcome measures and questionnaires. There are no limits in terms of how much access parents have to the platform and, if a young person and their worker agree, there is no reason why a young person’s parents could not be involved in using some of the other tools too.
									</div>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="faqItem">What are the benefits of using IncludeME?</span>
									<div class="faqDiv">
										We hope that IncludeME encourages:
										<br /><br />
										<ul>
											<li>More collaborative ways of working</li>
											<li>Shared decision making</li>
											<li>Enhanced patient experience</li>
											<li>Better outcomes for young people</li>
											<li>A sense of confidence and empowerment for young people and their families</li>
